const multiLineString = `This is a multiline string.
You can include multiple lines of text
without using concatenation or escape characters.

You can also include variables and expressions easily:
const name = 'Pijush';
const greeting = \`Hello, \${name}!\`;

console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Pijush!`;

console.log(multiLineString);
